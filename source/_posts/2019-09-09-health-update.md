description: An update about my health and wellness. What a year I've had.

It's been a very long and crazy 12 months for me.

It's been a little over a year now since I started a journey dealing with cancer. What started out as a weird lump on my right leg which strangely didn't hurt turned into a year full of scans, multiple diagnoses, multiple hospital visits as an inpatient and outpatient, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, recovery and therapy which has taken up a significant amount of my life.

And I haven't said very much about it all.

There are people who are close to me that know about everything, I've told some people some things, but for the most part I don't really like discussing it. Part of it was the hectic nature of treatment. My diagnosis changed nearly 4 times in the four months of starting to cure me. The other part sadly is that every time treatment plans ot the diagnosis changed, it wasn't really good news. Finally, at the end of september 2018 after some major surgery I recieved probably the most life changing news of the whole ordeal.

My cancer is incurable.

After 6 months of trying to cure my cancer, the treatments for it didn't go as well as doctors hoped. The chemotherapy that started the week after my diagnosis was cancelled after 2 months and the doctors planned for surgery. Surgery removed the primary tumor in my leg and the doctors were happy they got it all. There was quite a chuck of muscle from my leg and a lot of lymph nodes removed too, but I luckily have full use of my leg still. After some extra scans to plan radiation to make sure what was removed would never come back, doctors found it had already been on the move again, and infected my pelvic bone. Pathology also could have a good look at my tumor and it was finally found that the sarcoma was a rare type which started in the endothelial cells of my veins. I get to be one of the lottery scale lucky people who gets a rare cancer called Angiosarcoma.

I was told this news the day before I was discharged from hospital, and I was devastated. I was flown home in a just able to walk state and I wasn't sure what on earth was going to happen to me. I spent a month feeling pretty numb to anything. I didn't want to give up though. I wanted to keep going and do what I can to be me again.

Doctors from the hospital referred me to my local hospital oncology in that time and soon started a treatment to simply prolong my life and keep things at bay. I was a daily pill called Votrient which seemed to be working. I started to try to be myself again and get on with doing things I liked. Eventually the tablet started to build up in my system, and it was starting to make me sick. I felt like this was just the slow demise to the end. Pain started to come from my leg and my pelvis, and I was unable to manage it, even with help from doctors. After 6 months on these tablets a CT scan showed that the tablets stopped helping and cancer started to attack my spine. It was time to change things again.

I stopped Votrient, I moved back in with my mum, I started a few more tablets for pain, and I was referred to radiation therapy. In the space of a week things changed dramatically. The awful feeling started to diminish and I felt well again. I could stay on top of the pain I was in. I felt more like my normal self. Radiation therapy started and it relieved pretty much all of my hip pain, and further radiation made my spine and neck feel better too. The next treatment in the line for me was another chemotherapy of a weekly infusion of Paclitaxel. I'm now in my second cycle of that and it is a cakewalk compared to my first chemotherapy protocol of VAC/IE, 5 chemotherapy drugs alternating every month.

So now I'm in an odd space in my life. I've been told by doctors I don't have a great deal time left. Doctors have given time frames but they all seem like they're completely wrong now. I'm on treatments to stop or slow things down as much as possible. I've been through a whole year of hospital visits, operations, treatments, feeling sick and awful, but now I feel like I've entered a more positive stage of things. For the last year I felt like I'm dying from cancer. Right now, I feel like I'm simply living with cancer. It may not sound like much, but it's a mindset that I feel helps me remember I'm still me and I'm mostly able to do what I want.

I guess I can say that right now I'm fine. I'm trying to get back to being me. Spending a year being sick has led me to simply drop a lot of aspects of my life which I used to do, and now I think it is time to pick them all back up. Part of that is coding and remembering how much I liked to program. My job was enough to fulfill that, but everything has led me to no longer have my job, and I don't feel reliable enough to actually program for another party at the moment. Time may change that, We will see. I'm hoping this site will help. I've failed many a blog before, but this time I'm trying a method of static site generation to make it more interesting for myself and I get to have more freedom in code than a traditional blogging platform.

Let's see how things go!
