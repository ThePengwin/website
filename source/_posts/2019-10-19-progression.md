Things change fast. What a pain in the lower back.

From last time I posted, day to day life was going quite well. Except for some tiredness and some pain, both of which are fully understandable, I was tolerating chemotherapy well and getting around being normal.

However, it was months since a CT or any scan to see how paclitaxel was working though. A fresh CT of nearly my entire body showed that paclitaxel had already stopped being very effective, after just 3 cycles. Metastases in the lumbar region, slight progression in "known but too tiny to do anything with" other regions that have always been there. I was disappointed, but not surprised. I didn't even feel like crying. It was just another down slope. The 4th? I've stopped counting.

Coming soon after though was something I didn't anticipate. I started to have difficulty walking, and in the space of 72 hours, I became unable to walk properly without extreme pain going down my left leg. A few days in the hospital to see more though an MRI and change pain medications happened, but with everything being incurable, there is only so much the doctors can really help with, and staying in hospital was not worth anyone's time. My magical mother sought out enough to make me as comfortable as possible at home, and back I came. It looked like there was to be more radiation to target what is causing nerves and disc damage in my spine.

Thanks to the timing of the checkup when chemotherapy was cancelled, radiation planning was already underway. It was not a long wait to start what seems to be the best possible treatment at present. I've now finished one session, and there looks to be more in the future. With luck, the metastatic damage will be mitigated and the nerve pressure and disc damage will subside and let me walk normally again.

In spite of my newfound disability I also went on a trip to see friends. The trip was something I was looking forward to and planned when I thought everything would be okay, and I had no idea things were progressing. Travelling with a disability has to have been one of the most exhausting things I've ever done. It would have been impossible without the friends I had with me, a great bunch of people from all around Australia whom I know exclusively through the internet. It's not a fun feeling getting used to being disabled and trying to enjoy yourself. I'm forever thankful to my friends for their help to accommodate me, and it made my week to see them all again.

So that brings me back home again and in a different predicament which isn't as happy or hopeful as last time. Getting around is harder, motivation is harder, picking up things I used to do doesn't seem so likely. But it all seems to be a wait and see thing. It feels like the difficulty slider has been jacked up one more notch, but the rewards of playing at that difficulty aren't any better. I guess another cue I can use from video game logic is to personify the antagonist and power on through sheer spite of them.

Until next time, I'm going to give this shitty progression a run for its money.
