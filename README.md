# My personal website - pengw.in
Just the source code that builds my website, https://pengw.in. How useful that is to anyone else, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

## Uses
 * [Jigsaw](https://github.com/tightenco/jigsaw)
 * Components from Jigsaw's [Blog Template](https://github.com/tightenco/jigsaw-blog-template)
 * [Mini.css] (https://github.com/Chalarangelo/mini.css)
 * [webfonts generator] (https://github.com/sunflowerdeath/webfonts-generator#readme) and some vectors from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

 ## Setup
 Make sure you have Composer and nodejs/npm set up
 Check the repo out
 `composer install and npm install`

 ## Development
 As jigsaw says, `npm run watch` to develop locally

 ## Time to publish
 I wrote `update-site.sh` to do that for me.
